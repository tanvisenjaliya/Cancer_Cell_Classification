### Dataset: 
Skin Cancer MNIST: HAM10000
<br> A large collection of multi-source dermatoscopic images of pigmented lesions
#### DataSource : https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kmader/skin-cancer-mnist-ham10000

File 1 consist of Convolution Neural networks, models are created using various optimizer and the accuracy is compared. <br>
File 2 consist of Recurrent Neural Network, models like LSTM and GRU are created using various optimizer and regularizer and the accuracy is compared. <br>
File 3 consist of MobileNet which is a pre-built model in Keras, Depthwise Separable convolution is used in the considerably quicker and smaller CNN architecture known as MobileNet. <br>
#### The reason of creating different files is different model requires different size of input tensor.
